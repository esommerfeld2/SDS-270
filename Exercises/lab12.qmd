## Introduction

In this lab, we will build a help file for a particular function. 

- **Goal:** By the end of this lab, you should be able to build a help file and identify each of its parts.

## Writing a help file

For an R package, we have discussed the various items it needs to be self-sufficient. We will look at a help file specifically and discover how to create one.

To start, locate your `mypackage` package that you created in the seventh class. Open the .Rproj file up and you should see your workspace.

We will be writing a help file for a single function, named `fibonacci`, which has the following specifications:

- Takes in one argument `n`, which is the number of values returned from the Fibonacci sequence
- Returns the sequence of the first `n` values in a Fibonacci sequence.

These specifications are flexible to help you decide on how you want to structured your `fibonacci` function.

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q1
Create a new .R file called `fibonacci.R` in the `/R` folder.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q2
In `fibonacci.R`, create your function. Write the function in the code chunk below as well.

```{r}
#' Fibonacci Function
#'
#' @description Return the first n values in the fibonacci sequence.
#' 
#' @details n can not be negative or 0. the function takes n and creates a loop that for each value from 1 to n the fibonacci sequence is calculated and the next number is printed. The loop ends when n is reached. 
#' @param n a number that represent the number of values you want returned
#'
#' @returns a list of numbers that that is n long that is the fibonacci sequence
#' @export
#'
#' @examples fibonacci(2); fibonacci(4)
fibonacci <- function(n){
    a <- 0
    b <- 1
  for (i in 1:n) {
    cat(a, " ")
    next_num <- a + b
    a <- b
    b <- next_num
  }
}

#Code used from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/r-language/r-program-to-print-the-fibonacci-sequence/ as I did not know what the fibanci sequence was
```


:::

Once done with the function in your R file, click inside the curly brackets. Then, go up to Code $\rightarrow$ Insert ROxygen Skeleton. You will see something like this in your R file.

Based on the code you've written, ROxygen will generate a minimum skeleton that will be used for creating your manual for `fibonacci.R`. You can take a look at the following link from ROxygen for more information on what arguments can be placed in these comments:

- [link](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/rd.html)

We will need an introduction to show the user what the function does.

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q3
For the first `#'` in your skeleton, write a title for the `fibonacci` function.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q4
Leave a `#'` for the next line. Afterwards, write `@description` in the next line, then write a one-sentence description of what the `fibonacci()` function does.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q5
Leave a `#'` for the next line. Afterwards, write `@details` in the next line, then write a few sentences about how the function operates and if there are any restrictions users should know about.

:::

You will notice that functions require three tags: `@param`, `@returns`, and `@examples`. We will fill these in one-by-one next.

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q6
You should see `@param` defined already in the skeleton. Add a quick sentence immediately after the input (on the same line) that discusses its type and what it represents.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q7
You should see `@return` defined already in the skeleton. Add a quick sentence immediately after (on the same line) that discusses the type and shape of the output, along with what it represents.

:::

::: {.callout-important}

##### Q8
Under `@examples`, provide two examples of how the `fibonacci()` function can be used. You can highlight edge cases if you want here.

:::

LAST STEP TO DO BEFORE YOU TURN IN:
You are now ready to build your manual! In the console, run `devtools::document()`. Then, type in `?mypackage3::fibonacci` in the console. You should now see your help file in the Help tab.

## Turn-in

On Moodle, turn in the following files:

- Your `fibonacci.R` file.
- Your `fibonacci.Rd` file.
